Interviewer: Hello, thank you for joining me today. Can you please tell me your name and a little bit about yourself?

Witness: Sure, my name is Jane and I'm a student at Chinhoyi University of Technology.

Interviewer: I'm sorry to hear about what happened to you. Can you tell me more about the robbery incident near the engineering complex?

Witness: Yes, it was around 1600hrs when I was ambushed by two men who demanded my electronic gadgets. I refused to give them and they ended up stabbing me.

Interviewer: Oh no, that's terrible. Did you receive any immediate help or medical attention?

Witness: It took some time for help to arrive. I had to wait for the university control to come to my aid. When they did arrive, they told me to get up and go to the clinic.

Interviewer: That sounds like a difficult and uncomfortable situation. Have you had any thoughts on how this kind of situation could be handled better?

Witness: Yes, I think that having a way to quickly alert authorities or emergency services would be helpful. It could save valuable time and potentially even prevent further harm.

Interviewer: That's a great idea. Did you hear about the Rapid Response System project that my group is trying to implement at the university?

Witness: No, I haven't. What is it?

Interviewer: It's a system that allows individuals to quickly send their location to a server in case of an emergency. The server then alerts emergency services and provides them with the location of the individual in need.

Witness: Wow, that sounds really helpful. I wish something like that had been available when I was attacked.

Interviewer: Yes, it definitely has the potential to save lives and prevent harm. Thank you for sharing your experience and thoughts on this matter. I wish you all the best in your recovery.
