Problem Specification:
Chinhoyi University of Technology lacks an efficient and effective emergency response system, which results in delayed response times and inadequate assistance during emergency situations. The current system requires individuals to run to the nearest guard to report an emergency, which can result in further harm to the victim and may delay the response of the university control. This system is outdated, unreliable and unable to meet the needs of a modern university environment. Therefore, there is a need for a new system that provides a fast, reliable and efficient response to emergencies, improving the safety and wellbeing of staff and students on campus.
