word-pseudocode of the client:
we define a class whose constants are server address and device id (these are needed for identification of end user)
we define a method of that class which returns device last known location as a string eg."123.456,-78.901" in longitude and latitude format
it does so by interfacing GPS(googleplayservices' API) to get last registered location OR network services to maybe triangulate location
this location is then sent to the server whose address is hard-coded as class constants(abstraction)
